                                        Dear $first_name $last_name,<br><br>
                                        
                                        I am delighted to offer you a place in the MBP Capital Global Macro Bootcamp. Out of over 200 applications, yours stood out. Your application demonstrated the intellectual curiosity, integrity, and hunger to learn that defines what we look for in our analysts.<br><br>
                                        
                                        <strong style="color: #3a8066;">What happens next?</strong><br><br>
                                        
                                        We will be creating a WhatsApp group with all the bootcamp trainees as part of MBP Capital. You'll receive an invitation to join shortly – this will be our primary communication channel for the bootcamp.<br><br>
                                        
                                        The first session will be held at <strong>CBG 1.07</strong> on <strong>Monday, 13th October 2025</strong> from <strong>6pm - 7pm</strong>. Over the coming weeks, you'll work alongside fellow analysts, learn our investment framework, and contribute to live research. This won't be easy – we'll challenge you, push you to think deeper, and expect you to come prepared. But I promise you'll leave with skills and insights that will serve you throughout your investing career.<br><br>
                                        
                                        <strong style="color: #3a8066;">Before the first session:</strong><br>

                                        • Ensure you have a valid MBP Capital membership through LSESU<br>
                                        • Prepare to bring a notebook, laptop, and an open mind<br>
                                        • <strong>No pre-reading required</strong> for the first session – just show up ready to learn<br><br>
                            
                                        From the 2nd week onwards, pre-readings will be sent out through the WhatsApp group chat before each session. We expect everyone to come prepared.<br><br>
                                        
                                                                               
                                        We're excited to have you join us. See you at the bootcamp.<br><br>
                                        
                                        Best,<br>
