                                        Dear $first_name $last_name,<br><br>
                                        
                                        I'm Bryan, co-president of MBP Capital's Fundamental Equities team. As you conclude your first week at LSE, I want to share something with you. 2 years ago, I was exactly where you are now. First year, staring at applications, wondering if I belonged in spaces like this. Here's the truth I discovered – LSE will hand you a blueprint for success in finance, a well-worn path from networking events to spring weeks to graduate schemes. But I couldn't help wondering – is life just about performative networking and CV-padding?<br><br>
                                        
                                        At MBP, the learning hasn't just been about markets or models. It's been about discovering that the best insights come from the most unexpected conversations, that your peers will push your thinking further than any textbook ever could, and that the friends you make here become the people who fundamentally shape how you see the world. I've learned that in investing, like in life, no one has all the right answers. But here's the beautiful part: we're discovering them together. Every pitch session, every debate, every late-night discussion about whether a company's moat is sustainable – it's all part of figuring it out, as a team, as a community, as students hungry to understand what really drives value.<br><br>
                                        
                                        I won't lie, when I applied in first year, I didn't think I'd get in. But I took the leap anyway, and things fell in place. We're not looking for people who have it all figured out. We're looking for <em>you</em> – someone curious enough to ask tough questions and brave enough to take that first step. If you're wondering whether you should apply, here's my advice: <em>take the leap</em>.<br><br>
                                        
                                        Your journey starts the moment you decide you're worth betting on.<br><br>
