                                        Dear $first_name $last_name,<br><br>
                                        
                                        Thank you for applying to MBP Capital. After careful consideration, we are unable to offer you a place in this year's bootcamp. I know this isn't the news you were hoping for, and I want you to know that this decision doesn't diminish the courage it took to apply.<br><br>
                                        
                                        This year, we received over 200 applications for a lecture theatre that seats just a fraction of that number. Your application was read by four MBP full-time analysts, and Andy and I personally reviewed every single rejection decision. We saw the effort, the emotion, and the intellectual curiosity that you brought to your application.<br><br>
                                                                               
                                        I can't emphasize this enough. This rejection is not the end of your journey in investing. It's the beginning. Some of our 3rd year portfolio managers were rejected in first year. They took the feedback, put their heads down, grew as analysts and as people, and returned in third year to lead teams. That path exists for you too. The difference between those who make it and those who don't isn't talent – it's persistence and the willingness to learn from setback.<br><br>
                                        
                                        You took charge of your learning. You put yourself out there. You applied. That hunger, that initiative, please hold onto it. Seek out other opportunities, read voraciously, build models, participate in stock pitch competitions, ask questions that make you uncomfortable. When you reapply – and I hope you do – show us how you've grown. We will be waiting, excited to learn about your growth.<br><br>
                                        
                                        Best,<br>
                                        Song Yi & Andriy<br>
